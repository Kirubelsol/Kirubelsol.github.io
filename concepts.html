            <p class=" my-2 ">Filters are circuit components that are significantly used in signal processing, electronics, and more fields.
              They are usually made of passive electrical components such as resistors and capacitors, or the passive components and an operational amplifier. These filters can pass or attenuate specific frequencies. Considering this, they can be used to refine signals such as in communcation system, reduce noise, and remove or enhance certain frequency ranges. As stated, there are two main types: Passive and Active filters.

                  <li>Kirchhoff's current law: states that the sum of current entering a junction is equal to the sum of current leaving the junction. In the figure to right, at the top, the current through \( R_1 \) is equal to the sum of current through \( R_2 \) and \( R_3 \). <br> \( i_1 = i_2 + i_3 \)   </li>
                  <li> Kirchhoff's voltage law: states that the sum of voltage across a closed loop is zero. In the bottom figure. \( V_i = V_C + V_R \) where \( V_C \) and \( V_R \) are the voltage across the capacitor and resistor respectively. </li>
                  <li>Voltage division: states that in series connection of components like resistors, the voltage drop across a component is proportiional to its impedance over the total circuit impedance. Kirchhoff's laws can be used to prove this. For instance, in the circuit to right: <br> \( i_R = i_C = i\) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \( V_R = iR \) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \( V_C = iZ_c \) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  \( V_i = i(R + Z_c) \) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \( i = {V_i \over {R+Z_c}} \) <br>
                  \( V_R = iR = V_i({R \over {R+Z_c}}) \) <br> Hence the voltage across the resistor is proportional to the resistance over the total circuit impedance. </li>

            <p > <span class ="fst-italic">Cutoff frequency</span>: The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the magnitude of \( Vout \over Vin \) is often defined to be below \( {-3dB =} {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \). In band-pass filter we have upper and lower cutoff frequencies. Cutoff frequency serves as the boundary between the frequencies that the filter allows to pass and attenuate. For instance in high-pass filter, below the cutoff frequency the magnitude of the signal starts to be signficantly attenuated. </p>
            <p > <span class ="fst-italic">Transfer function</span>: a mathematical expression describing how the filter alters the magnitude and phase of the input signal helping us understand how the filter process the signals. The transfer function is used to come up with a bode plot to visualize the magnitude and phase change across frequencies. </p>
            <p > <span class ="fst-italic">Gain</span>: indicates the amplification or attenuation factor applied to the input signal due to the filter at different frequencies.</p>
            <p > <span class ="fst-italic">Phase shift</span>: refers to the phase difference introduced to the input signal due to the filter which indicates the shift in timing between the input and output signal measured in radians or degrees. signal within a certain frequency range while passing signals that are not in the range. It is used to avoid unwanted frequencies in signals.</p>
            <p >  <span class ="fst-italic">Quality factor</span>:  a dimensionless parameter commonly used in band-pass and band-stop filters indicating the performance of the filter. It is the ratio of the center frequency to the bandwidth of the filter. Center frequency is the arithmentic mean of the upper and lower cutoff frequency or the geometric mean which is the square root of the cutoff frequencies product. Bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies that passes through in bandpass filter or that is attenuated in bandstop filters.  A higher quality factor value indicates narrow pass band of frequencies making it highly selective while lower value indicates wider bandwidth region. A higher Q value filter can be used in precise frequency selection application while a lower value filter can be used broader frequency coverage.</p>
